# Prediction-of-Boston-Housing-Prices-using-Data-Science
In this project a prediction of **Boston Housing Prices** has done.
Python is used with the librabies *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*.
More specifically ***Sklearn*** library is used to import data of Boston Housing Complex.
Depending on **13** different attributes, like ***'per capita crime rate', 'average number of room per dwelling', 'nitric oxide concentration', 'pupil-teacher ratio per town', 'full-value property-tax rate'*** etc. There are **506** numerical data for each attributes. First a dataframe is created with all the features or attributes as columns. A new feature TARGET is added to the previous dataframe and a bar-graph is plotted to represent the correlation between TARGET feature and other features.
Rest of the part shows how to predict a prices depending on the feature LSTAT (% lower status of the population) with the normalised data.
### MEAN SQUARE ERROR
The code helps to evaluate the mean square error value with the original data and the predicted data. The 
The selected feature LSTAT can be changed as per requirement.
